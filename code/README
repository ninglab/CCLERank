--------------------------------------------
General information
--------------------------------------------
	This code provides the pLETORg algorithm for the usage of
	"Drug Selection via Joint Push and Learning to Rank".

--------------------------------------------
Iuput files
--------------------------------------------
	The required input files include:
		- cell line - drug response matrix file
                - cell line similarity matrix file
		- sensitive threshold file
	
	The cell line - drug response matrix file should be formatted as follows:
		- Each row represents a cell line.
		- Each column represents a drug (fields separated by commas).
		- The values in the matrix represent the response value of a certain drug on a certain cell line. 
			- Lower AUC value means a drug is more sensitive, thus the drug should be ranked higher.
			- Missing values are represented by "nan".
			- If a sensitivity score is 0 in training/testing file, it means this score is held out for testing/training, and the score could be found in the corresponding testing/training file. Such 0 scores will not be used for training/testing.


		- Example:
			"0.2,2.5,1.7,nan"
			"nan,0.4,2.5,0.9"
			"0.3,3.2,nan,nan"

	The cell line similarity matrix file should be formatted as follows:
                - Each row/column represents a cell line.
		- The values in the matrix represent the similarity between two cell lines.
		- The order of the cell lines should be the same as that in the cell line - drug response matrix file.
		- Example:
                        "0.1,0.6,0.7,0.9"
                        "0.8,0.4,0.5,0.2"
                        "0.7,0.2,0.5,0.6"

	The sensitive threshold file should be formatted as follows:
		- There is one column in the file.
		- Each row represents a cell line.
		- The value in each row represents a drug is sensitive if the drug response is smaller than this value


--------------------------------------------
Output files
--------------------------------------------
	There are four output files:
		- train_U_file
		- train_V_file
		- pred_file

	train_U_file:
		- The train_U_file contains the cell line latent vectors.
		- Each row represents a cell line.
		- Each column represents a latent dimension (fields separated by commas).

        train_V_file:
		- The train_V_file contains the drug latent vectors.
		- Each row represents a laten dimension.
		- Each column represents a drug (fields separated by commas).

	pred_file:
		- The pred_file contains the predicted ranking scores of drugs in cell lines.
		- Higher ranking score means a drug is ranked higher in a cell line (different from cell line - drug response matrix file).
		- Other formats of pred_file are the same as in cell line - drug response matrix file.
